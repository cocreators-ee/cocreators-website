description: Suomen Tilaajavastuu had a vision to build a new kind of a data
  platform, but was missing the resources to design the architecture in detail
  and take lead of the technical team. Cocreators provided the expertise necessary
  to get the vision on the right track, with a clear iterative plan to bring
  the project to fruition with minimal up-front expenses.
